    <h1>Staying motivated throughout the semester</h1>

  <main class="post-main"><p>The start of the fall semester always has a unique energy to it. Most
students, after promising to stay productive throughout the summer, come
to Dal with excitement for what’s to come. “It will be different this
time”, they say (at least I do). We enter the new semester with hopes to
stay on top of schoolwork and go to every class. Unfortunately, it often
turns out to be the academic version of your New Year’s resolution. You
say that you’ll stay on top of your work, only to see it gradually pile
up as the semester goes on. This post will outline some of the tips that
helped me most to keep up with those hard courses throughout the
semester.</p>

<h2 id="go-to-class-even-if-you-dont-understand-anything">Go to class, even if you don’t understand anything</h2>

<p>The urge to skip lectures creeps up on all of us, but making it a
regular habit can mean missing out on key information for your
assessments. Even for the instructors that only seem to read off the
slides, they are the ones that make your exams, believe it or not. This
means that their opinions, problem-solving approaches, and communication
skills that they display in lecture will also be expressed in the
assessments. Going to class gives you more exposure to the way that the
instructor thinks and how they convey their message. This can mean the
difference between accurately comprehending what a question is testing
you on versus misunderstanding and getting a zero.</p>

<p>This may sound mean, but the bar truly is on the floor. I think profs
really appreciate students that take the time to go to class and engage
with the material. If their passion for teaching hasn’t been snuffed
out, they will most likely pose questions to students throughout the
lecture. Just answer them, it doesn’t have to be correct or even close,
it just has to be a genuine effort. Profs often take note of the
students that are taking part in lecture, because they’ll assume that
they’re genuinely trying when they need help during office hours. Also,
this means that they’ll drop hints throughout the semester to reward
students for actually taking the time to come to class. This can be
anything from what’s coming on the assessments, unique ways to think
about a problem and deriving a solution, and additional resources that
you may not have come across otherwise.</p>

<p>There is one thing that is not talked about, but I truly believe exists
and that’s student comradery. Going to class on a regular schedule means
that you’re seeing the same faces regularly. Even if you never speak to
each other you are becoming aware of each other’s existence. If you
often see a face for long enough, it will be much easier to go up and
talk to them later on if you need to ask a question, for example. Most
times I’ve approached a student before class starts to ask a question I
would not even need to introduce myself. They’ve seen me and already
know who I am, a student struggling to understand the course just like
them.</p>

<h2 id="go-to-office-hours">Go to office hours!</h2>

<p>Spooky, I know. Going to office hours has been the main motivator for
staying on top of my course work. Take note of when the instructor holds
office hours, and make it a point to go each week, if you can. Be sure
that you have one to two questions concerning the current or previous
week’s material that you would like to discuss further. By doing this,
you’re forcing yourself to do a mini-review of the lecture material,
then you’re asking the instructor one-on-one about material that you
might have missed or went over your head. The instructor will definitely
take a different approach to explaining the concept than when they did
it in class. First, they know that if it didn’t work the first time, it
won’t work again! Second, they’ll probably have more time during office
hours to go in-depth on the topic should they need to.</p>

<p>When explaining complex topics to a class full of students, the
instructor often has to explain in a generic way to reach as many
students as possible. However, if the explanation did not quite click
with you, going to office hours regularly can give the instructor time
to understand what methods of instruction work best for you on a
personal basis. If you have gone to office hours regularly, the
instructor most likely has an idea of what helps make the material click
for you. Make a habit of going to office hours as it is especially
important if you don’t understand what’s going on in the course.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that going to office hours throughout the
semester when not understanding the course material is quite different
that showing up for the first time the day before the final. If the
instructor has never personally met you, they will have no idea on how
to actually help you. So, it is completely fine to show up being
completely lost about the material, as long as you’re not showing up at
the last possible opportunity. Second, be sure to not ask question
regarding the course that can easily be found in the syllabus. If you
have a question regarding the course policies, make sure to check the
syllabus first to get the quickest possible answer and not waste your
own time. Show that you’ve done the work beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude…</h2>

<p>The things that have helped me the most are to go to class and office
hours regularly. I’m sure it sounds dumb to some, but these are the two
things that ensure that you get exposure to the material more than once
before you even begin studying for an assessment. It also helps build
closer connections with the instructor and the students in your class.
These two habits help create a major change in how you interact with the
course material throughout the semester, which will result in a lot of
improvements. It is often the students that aren’t afraid to ask
questions and resolve any issues they have with the material that end up
doing well in the course.</p>
