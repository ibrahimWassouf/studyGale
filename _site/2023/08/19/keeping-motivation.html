    <h1>Staying motivated throughout the semester</h1>

  <main class="post-main"><p>The start of the fall semester always has a unique energy to it. Most
students after promising to stay productive throughout the summer come
to Dal with excitement for what’s to come. “It will be different this
time”, they say (at least I do). Unfortunately, it often turns out to be
the academic version of your New Year’s resolution. You say that you’ll
stay on top of your work, only to see it gradually pile up as the
semester goes on. This post will outline some of the tips that helped me
most with staying on top of those hard courses throughout the semester.</p>

<h2 id="go-to-class-even-if-you-dont-understand-anything">Go to class, even if you don’t understand anything</h2>

<p>The urge to skip lectures creeps up on all of us, but making it a
regular habit can mean missing out on key information for your
assessments. Even for the instructors that only seem to read off the
slides, they are the ones that make your exams, believe it or not. This
means that their opinions, problem-solving approaches, and communication
skills that they display in lecture will also be expressed through the
assessments. Going to class gives you more exposure to the way that the
instructor thinks and how they convey their message. This can mean the
difference between accurately comprehending what a question is quizzing
you on versus misunderstanding and getting a zero.</p>

<p>This may sound mean, but the bar truly is on the floor. I think profs
really appreciate students that take the time to go to class. This means
that they’ll drop hints throughout the semester. This can be anything
from what’s coming on the assessments, unique ways to think about a
problem and deriving a solution, and additional resources that you may
not have come across otherwise.</p>

<p>There is one thing that is not talked about, but I truly believe exists
and that’s student comradery. Going to class on a regular schedule means
that you’re seeing the same faces regularly. Even if you never speak to
each other you are becoming aware of each other’s existence. If you
often see a face for long enough, it will be much easier to go up and
talk to them later on if you need to ask a question, for example. Most
times I’ve approached a student before class starts to ask a question I
would not even need to introduce myself. They’ve seen me and already
know who I am, a student struggling to understand the course just like
them.</p>

<h2 id="go-to-office-hours">Go to office hours!</h2>

<p>Spooky, I know but going to office hours has been the main motivator for
staying on top of my course work. Take note of when the instructor holds
office hours, and make it a point to go each week, if you can. Be sure
that you have one to two questions concerning the current or previous
week’s material that you would like to discuss further. By doing this,
you’re forcing yourself to do a mini-review of the lecture material,
then you’re asking the instructor one-on-one about something that you
might have missed or went over your head. The instructor will definitely
take a different approach to explaining the concept than when they did
it in class. First, they know that if it didn’t work the first time, it
won’t work again! Second, they’ll probably more time during office hours
to go more in-depth should they need to.</p>

<p>When explaining complex topics to a class full of students, the
instructor often has to explain in a generic way to reach as many
students as possible. However, if the explanation did not quite click
with you, going to office hours regularly can give the instructor time
to understand what methods of instruction work best for you and lead you
better without taking time away from the allotted lecture time. So,
going to office hours is especially important if you don’t understand
what’s going on in the course.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that going to office hours throughout the
semester when not understanding the course material is quite different
that showing up for the first time the day before the final. If the
instructor has never personally met you, they will have no idea on how
to actually help you. So, it is completely fine to show up being
completely lost about the material, just make sure that you’re not
showing up at the last possible opportunity. Second, be sure to not ask
question regarding the course that can easily be found in the syllabus.
If you have a question regarding the course policies, make sure to check
the syllabus first to get the quickest possible answer and not waste you
own time.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the things that have helped me the most are to go to
class and office hours regularly. I’m sure it sounds dumb to some, but
these are the two things that ensure that you get exposure to the
material more than once before you even begin studying for an
assessment. It also helps build closer connections with the instructor
and the students in your class. It might not seem like a lot, but this
creates a major change in how you interact with the course material
throughout the semester which will result in a lot of improvements. It
is often the students that aren’t afraid to ask questions and resolve
any issues they have with the material that end up doing well in the
course.</p>
