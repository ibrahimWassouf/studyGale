    <h1>Escaping the console</h1>

  <main class="post-main"><p>What we learn in class is great, foundational knowledge but it would
take far too long to learn to write programs that do more than just
output something into the console if you were to wait to learn it in a
course. Students should take the time to explore, learn, and apply what
they learn in class to side projects that more closely resemble
real-world software.</p>

<p>This is for students who are starting their venture into creating their
own personal projects that may need a little push in the right
direction. If you’ve ever looked at products or other’s projects and
thought to yourself “How did they do that? If I were to do something
similar, where would I even start?” I was the same, in fact, I still am.
The best way I can explain it is that you need a good mental model of
how things work to get good at creating software, whatever that means to
you. Starting out, your mental model might be very fuzzy if not
non-existent. As you gain exposure to various knowledge from practice
and learning, you’ll gain a clearer picture of how it works in your
head, and you’ll be able to focus on more advanced topics as you go.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-really-start-from-scratch">You don’t really start from scratch</h2>

<p>Say you are like me, interested in creating a website with more than
just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The reality is that you’ll need
a lot more than just small little scripts/programs to get your website
off the ground. For example, a very basic thing you will need is a
server, a local one to use for development rather than hosting. Do you
know how to make a local server? I sure don’t. Maybe we’ll both figure
it out in the future. In the meantime, we’ll use software that was
already created to quickly achieve our short-term goal of creating small
side projects. As time goes on, hopefully the long-term goal is to turn
all that seems like magic into abstractions.</p>

<p>Starting out you’ll heavily rely on frameworks and libraries
specifically designed to tackle a problem. For example, I used the
Django web framework to create my first full-stack website. It’s a
batteries included framework, meaning that it provides many solutions
that you may use during development built-in. For example, it
automatically creates an admin page for your website, has it’s own ORM
software to query your database with Python rather than SQL, and so on.
You too will most likely rely on many frameworks, libraries, and
projects to build whatever it is that you are building.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that you are most likely going
to start using these more like clutches rather than tools. I was proud
when I made my first website, but it was a trash pile that was extremely
finicky. In the end, if I were to modify anything in the code, the whole
thing would stop functioning. This is because I did not really know what
I was doing. I was just mashing things together that I got from the
documents, hoping it would work. Don’t just get good at using a tool,
get good at understanding the underlying mechanisms that make it work.</p>
