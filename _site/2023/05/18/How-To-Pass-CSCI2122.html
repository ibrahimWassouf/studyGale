    <h1>How To Pass CSCI2122 - Draft</h1>

  <main class="post-main"><p>The Systems Programming course is often labelled as the hardest course required
to be taken in the department. While this course is not easy by any means, it
is possible to do well. This means that you should have no trouble passing the
course if you apply yourself and do not have chronic test anxiety. Again, this
does not mean that it’s easy to pass this course by putting minimal effort. On
the contrary, my friends and I have struggled hard in class, each one receiving
an unexpected blow throughout the semester. While progressing through the
degree, this is the first course where slacking off and cutting corners will
seriously disadvantage you during the assessments. Other first and second year
CSCI courses are generally easy in the sense that the material is
straightforward and the course curriculum isn’t incredibly demanding, which
allows students to do not show up to class, cram before assessments and leave
relatively unscathed. CSCI2122 is not a course like that. It requires genuine
effort and an introduction to what is expected from students moving on to the
similar upper-year courses. Those that pass 2122 and haven’t switched to
applied will likely find that 2122 was the hardest course for this reason.</p>

<h2 id="section-1--how-to-go-to-class">Section 1 – How to go to class</h2>

<p>Anyone that tells you that it’s unnecessary to attend lectures is, quite
frankly, wasting their money. Skipping lectures can negatively affect your
grades. The only ones who don’t lose marks are the ones who are good at playing
the academic game, but don’t let that fool you. The hidden cost to skipping
lecture lies in your emotions and well being. Humans aren’t built to process
the unknown, and there is a lot of unknowns in classes you don’t attend. The
scope of the material, what is expected of you, your grasp on the material, and
a bunch of other factors are unknown to students that aren’t engaged throughout
the semester. This can lead to more unnecessary stress. Save yourself the
trouble and go to class – and listen.</p>

<p>Another hard truth is that every course, no matter how dull or stupid it may
seem, has valuable lessons that you can extract from it. It all depends on how
much effort you put in to find them and keep them. If you are only going to
university to get a degree. I’m here to give you some bad news. A degree these
days isn’t worth much, and you’ll need to put more effort than just going
through the motions of academia to succeed, that is if you’re idea of success
goes beyond grabbing a fancy piece of paper. I can’t tell you why a degree
isn’t worth what it used to be. Maybe it’s because of grade inflation or
rampant cheating, perhaps it could be because degrees are only focused on
building your foundations, while real-world tasks are getting ever more
complex. In any case, a degree is useful (necessary if you ask me) but it no
longer demarcates the exceptional from the rest. So, how does this relate to
not going to class? Well if there are students going above and beyond pushing
their limits, and there are ones that are doing just what is expected of them,
where does that lead the ones who are doing less? I’ll leave that up to you to
decide, there are few who didn’t already have an opinion on the matter. I’m of
the opinion that you decide what to make of any situation. If there is a class
that seems far removed from what is expected from you in industry, there are
still a lot of foundational knowledge and skills, hell even things about
yourself, that you can learn along the way. Nothing is a waste unless you make
it so.</p>

<p>Now onto lectures themselves. This may seem like I’m stating the obvious, but a
university lecture is not the same as lessons you find in other programs and
institutions. The professor is not there to solely teach you the material. In
fact, some professors structure their lectures to not teach you the material at
all. Instead, they are there to teach you how to think about and approach the
material. This is the reason why some, if not most, professors expect you to
read the corresponding readings before attending the lectures. The kind ones
structure their lectures as if you didn’t read them. The good ones do not.</p>

<p>To gain the most out of lectures, you need to address them in a certain way.
You have to view lectures as an abridged version of the textbook. The lectures
provide few very important details needed for success in the course. First,
they highlight what the professors deems to be the most important information
to know (or the information that they felt comfortable including in an 11 week
course). If you choose to skip lectures, you are essentially leaving yourself
to waste time deciphering the lecture slides and notes to find out this
information. This can be deceiving, just because there may be a lot of writing
on the slide does not necessarily mean it is the most important. You have no
sense of where the professor spent most of the lecture time discussing.</p>

<p>Not attending lecture is a huge waste of time. You have three hours of lectures
per course in week. Most of the students that skip lectures are not being
productive in another task. So, not only did you add an 60-90 minutes to your
busy schedule to catch up on the material, you did not make it up by completing
another task that frees up your time. This means that you are essentially
doubling the amount of time that you have to spend studying the material. When
you go to class, even if you are completely lost about the material. You are
still gaining exposure to the material. When you go back to review you will be
able to recognize the terms and topics that were discussed in class. You will be
able to remember which topics the instructor stressed on the most – That is, if
you paid attention in class rather than watch a stream of league of legends or
chess (please stop).</p>

<h2 id="section-2--learn-to-read-the-textbook">Section 2 – Learn to read the textbook</h2>

<p>It isn’t uncommon to be assigned whole chapters to be read in conjunction with
the lectures. This may seem unreasonable, but keep in mind that they are not
tasking you with reading every word and memorizing it. Reading textbook follow a
different approach than you would with other mediums like an article or a novel.
We’ll talk about two important things to keep in mind when reading the textbook.</p>

<p>There are many strategies used that focus on either increasing reading
comprehension or speed. There are things like using an epub reader and
increasing the margins to lower the number of saccades your eyes make across the
page and avoiding internally speaking the words when reading. These sorts of
hacks may or may not work for you, but they are just a google search away if
you’re interested. However, the most important advice that definitely isn’t
hackish is to scan through the chapter multiple times before actually reading
the book. There is a process for this and is easily found online, just google
“how to read a textbook”. The variations all do the same thing, they develop an
outline of the content in the chapter before you actually begin understanding
the material.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to getting a summary of the content before learning.
First, we aren’t build to process the unknown very well. When we face a topic
that we don’t understand (especially when an assessment is coming up) we tend to
become bogged down by our emotional responses. We may be stressed and anxious
from the upcoming assessment and are more worried about failing than actually
learning. If you read a chapter or go through the lecture without having a clear
idea of what the main topics are. Every time you encounter a new key term that
you don’t know, it will elicit a genuine fear response in you. Getting a summary
of the content beforehand helps you prepare for what’s coming so there are no
suprises.</p>

<p>Reviewing the content before will also allow you to one get a sense of what are
the most important take-aways from the chapter and help you avoid getting caught
up in small or irrelevant details. Who knew that the <em>learning objectives</em> at
the start of every chapter is actually useful for something.</p>

<p>You should try them out and figure out what works for you if you’d like.ast
piece of advice for csci2122 specifically, do the textbook questions. This may
vary slightly depending on the instructor, but it is highly likely that most of
the questions that come up on the quizzes and assignments will be very similar
if not idetical to the textbook questions. On most of the quizzes, I landed
above an A, except for one. For one quiz I didn’t have the time to review any
of the material and ended up getting 22%. When reviewing for the final, I
realized that every question on that quiz was as close to a copy paste to the
questions in the textbook. If you think that this indicates that you don’t need
to attend the lectures, reread section 1.</p>

<h2 id="section-3--how-to-not-fear-practicums">Section 3 – How to not fear practicums</h2>

<p>Honestly, I did not perform the best on the practicums. Although, I can provide
a story if asked why it is by no means objective, and I don’t have all the
facts. However, you can learn something from someone’s mistakes, and I’m here to
tell them. First, it’s good to know what the practicums are intended to test.
They’re meant to ensure that you know how to code in C and that also means that
you’ve actually done the practicum. You need to learn C to move on to CSCI3120
and not horribly fail. Second, practicums test a bit about your problem solving
skills. It won’t be hard and from what I’ve experience it shouldn’t be harder
than what you’ve been exposed to in the CSCI1110 practicums. The most important
skill that you need to ensure that you do well is to know how to debug you’re
code. Better yet, how to avoid bugs in your code. There are classic cases that
lead to some hard to solve bugs. I have spent 5 hours of my life solving a
segfault (a type of memory access bug) because I accessed a variable that
belongs to a null variable. Knowing how to properly write Null checks and
avoiding common practices that to segfaults will help you not waste time
debugging during the practicum. A good thing to do is learn how to use Valgrind
from the start of the semester, because you’ll surely run into segfaults
way before they teach you how to use it.</p>

<p>The best way to prepare for the practicum is to learn how to calm down in a
stressful situation. If you are faced with a random bug and you have ten minutes
left in your practicum. Not being frantic and removing tunnel vision when you’re
reviewing your code will be necessary to fix any issues that come your way.</p>

<p>I have heard of some students that choose to do the labs in VSCode instead of
vim. I think that is a recipe for disaster because you’re essentially avoiding
all the practice you get from using the vim text editor. There is not much that
you need to learn how to use it effectively, and being comfortable in your
testing environment is far more important than being comfortable while doing
your labs.</p>

<p>Last thing, read the docs. If you’re spending hours trying to figure out a lab,
just know that all the answers on how to solve the requirements are written
explicitly in previous pages, probably under the bolded headings. Yes I know
that it’s 20 pages long. Yes, that is completely fair in a university course.
Especially given that most of the information are things you already learned in
previous courses. It won’t take that long to skim through as a review and to
pick up the few pieces of new information such as using pointers and makefiles.</p>
