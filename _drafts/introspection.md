title: Introspection alleviates mindless learning

Let's begin with defining what mindless learning is. For this blog, I'll
say that it is learning for the sake of completion rather than acquiring
a new skill or perspective. The problem with focusing on finishing a
task, rather than actually learning from it, is that you are left with
nothing but the empty claim "I have completed this course, degree,
certificate, etc." What people often miss is that such claims are
heuristics to indicating that you hold a certain skills or knowledge on
a subject. The hope is that by going through a course or degree, you
have either implicitly or explicitly acquired the important bits from
them. Mindless learning is worrying more about taking actions associated
with learning, than actually learning itself.

Every student has completed a course only to forget everything once the
final is submitted. This become an issue when it occurs for more often
than not. People have become very good at completing tasks but not good
at retaining the value from them. This is why we often hear things such
as degrees have become useless. A degree in itself is useless.
You can easily coast through it without learning a single thing. It's
what you make of it that is important. The valuable thing about
universities is that they provide excellent environments for you to grow
both personally and intellectually. If you knew yourself well enough to
not need to be guided by an institution, then of course going to a
university would be a waste of time. However, you'd need a lot of
introspection to achieve that, which brings us to our topic.

## Discover how you think

Understanding how you think is understanding the environment and type of
knowledge that you need in order to learn effectively. If you're like
me, you'll need to adopt thought processes from more experienced people,
and how they use information to extrapolate onto new ideas. Others may
best learn by doing. Seeing the process occur in front of them and
coming up with their own mental model. They observe and refine it as
they go.

The importance of knowing how _you_ think is that it will help you seek
the right resources and the right patterns throughout your learning. For
example, whenever I get something wrong in an assessment, I review what
was going through my head that lead me to the wrong answer and compare
it the thought process of the instructor and how they reached the
correct answer. Along the way, I discover what heuristics I rely on when
problem-solving, when they actually serve me and when they lead me
astray.

## Visualize, pictorially or not

Knowing how you tend to organize information in your mind will help you
know when you've reached a point where you truly do understand the topic
at hand. This is often what I refer to as having a mental model on the
subject. I need not to literally visualize it in my head the same as I
would a picture of something. Sometimes, it can be as simple as a list
of steps that you take to reach from the starting state to the end
state. For example, I usually know when I have a question down, whether
it be to code a data-structure or solve a floating point number
conversion by being able to see the steps that I have to take from the
very beginning till the very end where I have derived my answer. Take
the time to really discern when you feel like you really know a topic
versus when topics feel a little fuzzy.
